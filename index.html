Once the meat is properly roasted and falls off the bone, people tend to eat every part of the pig, and the crispy, reddish-brown, crackling skin is especially beloved. 
                                   &nbsp Lechon is often served with a thick and rich liver sauce that is cooked with sugar, fresh herbs, and vinegar. If anything is left after the feast, the leftovers are often made into lechon slaw, slowly cooked with vinegar, garlic, and liver sauce for that extra bit of flavor.</i></p>

No surprise, then, that it’s a regular item in eateries or hawker-style stands near schools, offices, construction sites, markets, and shopping centers, as well as in Chinese restaurants. &nbsp This snack is another ode to Cebu’s strong ties to China’s Fujian province, which is where many Chinese emigrants here hail from. In their language, ngohiong (or ngohiong-hun) simply refers to the five-spice powder that gives fried ngohiong its distinctive flavor.</i></p>

But there are also other versions in other provinces like Cagayan de Oro, Bohol and Davao. Imagine, cooking a dish for almost a day makes you wonder what kind of dish that took so long to cook. The average cooking time for this dish is about seven hours. The name of this dish “balbacua” came from the Spanish word “barbacoa” which means cooking meat very slowly on an open fire for several hours. Maybe our ancestors named it balbacua because of the length of time involved in cooking. Just in case you can’t find ox tail, which is very expensive compared to other parts of the cow, you can also use the combination of ox skin and beef ribs to simulate the ox tail which is mostly skin and bones and some fatty tissues.</i></p>

For those that are not familiar with this dish, paklay is a stew made-up of pig and cow innards. This dish is popular in the southern parts of the Philippines and is best enjoyed as a main dish or as pulutan.</i></p>
